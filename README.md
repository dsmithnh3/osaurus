> Status note, April 1 2026: the repo contains a real native VMLX runtime and real Osaurus integration, but some older docs below this repo previously mixed planned work, landed code, and aspirational status. This README is now aligned to the current branch state.

## Goal

Replace Osaurus's `mlx-swift-lm` backend with a native Swift inference engine that:
- uses `mlx-swift` for tensor ops only
- loads architectures natively in Swift
- handles hybrid SSM, MoE, MLA, and JANG mixed-precision weights
- provides a multi-layer cache stack with hybrid-safe behavior
- integrates directly into the Osaurus app, API, tools, and settings flow

## Current Branch Status

### Verified Working

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Standard transformer path | Verified with real local models such as Llama 3.2 1B and Qwen 2.5 0.5B |
| Qwen 3.5 hybrid SSM path | Verified with real JANG models; hybrid cache split and restore paths are in use |
| Osaurus integration | `VMLXServiceBridge` is wired into `ChatEngine`, settings, model discovery, and cache inspector |
| Cache stack fundamentals | Paged cache, memory cache, prefix cache, disk cache, SSM companion cache, and cache coordinator are implemented |
| Tool/reasoning parsing | VMLX tool/reasoning parsers are wired through the bridge and app settings; MLX reasoning overrides still apply on the app streaming path |

### Implemented But Still Under Active Validation

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| NemotronH | Native model class landed and recent fixes corrected Mamba2 scan, MoE routing, latent projections, and attention projection dimensions |
| Mistral Small 4 | Native MLA + MoE path landed and recent fixes corrected config decoding and inference alignment with Python reference |
| TurboQuant | Swift encode/decode, live `TurboQuantKVCache`, and cache-store/fetch preservation are now all wired on the active VMLX path; `TQDiskStore` still is not the active L2 path |

### Important Current Caveats

- The runtime still executes one active generation task at a time. Scheduler and batching primitives exist, but true multi-request continuous batching is not the active hot path yet.
- Hybrid partial hits now attempt boundary-aligned SSM re-derive when attention KV exists but the matching SSM companion state is missing. The current request still full-prefills when re-derive is pending or unavailable.
- `SSMReDeriver` is now on the live VMLX hybrid recovery path, but it is still fallback-heavy for large or unavailable checkpoints.
- Hybrid prefill currently uses single-phase prefill plus a post-prefill SSM snapshot. Earlier two-phase checkpointing plans were backed out from the hot path after SSD/Mamba2 hangs.
- VMLX paged cache now commits request blocks during prefill and rewrites them to the final representation at store time, but the attention kernel still consumes contiguous live K/V arrays rather than a true paged-attention kernel interface.
- Vision preprocessing and embedding cache exist; full vision encoder inference is still pending.
- MiniMax tokenizer incompatibilities still block trustworthy text generation quality.
- Qwen 3.5 35B JANG still needs a deeper MoE-path optimization pass. Adaptive prefill chunking is in, but the quantized expert prefill path remains the current bottleneck.

## What The Engine Actually Does Today

### Cache Stack

- Paged KV cache via block hash chains for the main prefix-reuse path
- Memory LRU cache and token-trie prefix cache
- Disk L2 safetensors cache with SQLite index
- SSM companion cache for hybrid models
- `gen_prompt_len` stripping so cache keys ignore assistant-generation suffix tokens
- When paged cache is off, prefix cache is now populated even if the memory tier is on
- Paged cache and disk cache can now preserve `.compressedAttention` entries on the normal reuse path instead of always degrading them to float
- The VMLX actor now commits paged blocks during prefill, aborts those in-flight blocks on cancellation/error, and rewrites committed blocks to the final TQ/SSM-safe form when the request finishes successfully

### Hybrid SSM Behavior

- Hybrid caches are represented explicitly as mixed `.attention` and `.ssm` layers
- SSM state is treated as path-dependent and non-truncatable
- Prefix-style reuse is safe only when the KV and SSM sides agree on the same boundary
- Hybrid exact-hit replay and hybrid partial-hit reuse now attempt boundary-aligned SSM re-derive before falling back
- The current request still full-prefills when the needed SSM checkpoint is unavailable or only arrives asynchronously

### TurboQuant Reality

- Swift implementations exist for `TurboQuantEncoder`, `TurboQuantKVCache`, `EncodedKeys`, `EncodedValues`, and `TQDiskStore`
- TurboQuant policy is now resolved from `TurboQuantConfig`, so hybrid JANG models keep the rule "KV only, never SSM"
- The live VMLX runtime now keeps eligible attention layers in `TurboQuantKVCache` after prefill and restores `.compressedAttention` back into that live cache type on cache hits
- Cross-turn cache store/fetch can now preserve `.compressedAttention` through paged, memory, prefix, and disk reuse paths, including cache-hit turns that extend an already-restored prefix
- Paged live-session finalization now rewrites committed blocks to compressed attention where the layer policy supports it, so paged reuse no longer has to fall back to stale float slices after a successful TQ run
- `TQDiskStore` still is not the active L2 path; persistent on-disk cache still uses `DiskCache`

```
Packages/VMLXRuntime/
  Sources/VMLXRuntime/   88 source files
  Tests/VMLXRuntimeTests 49 test files
```

Main areas:
- `Core/` model loading, configs, hybrid cache abstractions
- `Cache/` paged, memory, prefix, disk, SSM companion, coordinator
- `Quantization/` JANG loading and TurboQuant pieces
- `Models/` standard, Qwen3.5, NemotronH, Mistral4, GPT-OSS, MLA, MoE, SSM utilities
- `Integration/` runtime actor and Osaurus-facing service layer

## Osaurus Integration

The current app wiring is real, not stubbed:

- `Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/Inference/VMLXServiceBridge.swift`
- `Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/Chat/ChatEngine.swift`
- `Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Settings/ConfigurationView.swift`
- `Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Model/ModelCacheInspectorView.swift`
- `Packages/OsaurusCore/Managers/Model/ModelManager.swift`

That integration covers:
- model discovery and de-duplication with MLX models
- model load/unload routing
- Local Inference settings passthrough
- parser overrides, with VMLX reasoning chunks bridged back into the app's `<think>` UI path
- cache stats/unload visibility in the app
